        <h2>Quick and Easy Avocado and Egg Sandwich</h2>
        <p>A simple variation on avocado toast, this easy to make fried egg sandwich is a great start to any day!</p>
        <p>While this recipe calls for a bagel, any bread will work just as well.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Bagel, sliced</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 Large egg</li>
            <li>1 Small avocado, peeled and pitted</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp softened cream cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast sliced bagel until golden brown.</li>
            <li>While bagel is toasting, heat butter in frying pan over medium heat and egg.  Pan fry until yolk is set or of desired consistency, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mash avocado, sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 tbsp cream cheese on each half of toasted bagel.  Top with seasoned avocado mash and egg.  Add more salt and pepper over egg if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>For a refined twist, substitute bagel with croissant and use brie instead of softened cream cheese.  Substitute fried eggs for scrambled according to preference.</p>
        <h3>Serving Suggestions</h3>
        <p>Serve with fresh fruit or pan roasted home fries and sliced tomato.</p>
